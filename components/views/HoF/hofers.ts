    blurb: `
    Football, like life, is about moments...if often made this argument about people like Frank Gore, a fantastic career but where are the breathtaking moments that you remember, that get you out of your seat?

    Mr Hester isn’t going to be the first name you see when you look up the statistics, he’s not the main reason sibon got to the dance, but if football, like life, is indeed about moments, and the chumbo is a microcosm of the 2, then Jacob Troy Hester provided the biggest one of the all when he vultured peyton, knowshon...and Toby.

    You hate to see it...actually...

    blurb: `
    Where have all the good quarterbacks gone and where are all the Gods? 
Where's the hot dog eating Hercules to fight the rising odds? 
Isn't there a long beach knight upon a fiery steed?

Unicorn needs a hero
I’m holding out for a hero to beat Kitch
He’s gotta be strong and he’s gotta be fast 
And he’s got to be Mark Sanchez who stepped in after Colin Kaepernick cost us dearly with a dreadful display in the semEYE finals. Butt fumbled himself into the Chumbo HOF.
