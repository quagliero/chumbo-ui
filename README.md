# Chumbo wiki
A place for all things Chumbo that get asked, answered, and then usually forgotten.

## Tiers
The Chumbo runs an ongoing 'tiering' process which is used to organise the [division selection](#division-selection) for the following season. The 12 teams in the league are ordered best to worst by their win percentage over the previous 3 seasons, and then broken into 3 groups of 4 (Tier 1, 2 and 3). If win percentages are the same, the tie is broken by points scored. 

You need one full year in the league to qualify for the Tiers (during your inaugural season you will be locked into Tier 3).

The [scumbo](#scumbo) automatically gets placed in Tier 3, this shift down results in every other team moving up 1 spot.

## Division selection
There are 4 divisions in the league and they each contain 3 teams. Each division is made up of one team from each of the tiers. Divisions are chosen in a snake-style draft order by the teams in Tier 1. There are no restrictions on whether you pick a team from Tier 2 or Tier 3 first, but you have to have one from each.

1. Tier 1.1
2. Tier 1.2
3. Tier 1.3
4. Tier 1.4
5. Tier 1.4
6. Tier 1.3
7. Tier 1.2
8. Tier 1.1

The division draft traditionally happens over a few days in March/April.

## Draft slot selections
The winner of the Consolation playoffs from the previous season holds the first draft slot selection, and the Scumbo is given the last. Selections 2 through 11 are done via a hat-pick lottery matching teams to draft slots during the NFL Draft. For ceremonial reasons, the order the remaining teams are drawn is done by the final standings of the previous season.

Note that these are draft slot _selection_ orders, and not the actual pick position. Once assigned your selection number, the official draft pick position takes place with each team taking it in turn (via their given draft slot selection) to choose from the available draft pick slots.

## Waivers
Waivers are done using a FAAB system and run daily on Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays at 1pm and Saturdays at 7pm. On Sundays and Mondays there are no waivers and all available players are Free Agents (in case last minute injuries or news force lineup changes).

## Scoring
The Chumbo uses standard scoring with the following caveats:
-1 for missed XP
-1 for missed FG < 30 yards

### Up for consideration
- K: +0.1 per FG yard over 30. (e.g. 49 yard field goal nets 4.9 points)
- DST: No 'points allowed' brackets, -0.1 per point allowed, 0.5 per TFL, 0.5 per PBU, 1 per FF

## Transaction locks
When your team has been mathematically eliminated from Chumbo Bowl, Scumbo Bowl, or Consolation Bowl contention, your roster is locked and you are unable to add/drop and make trades. You may only trade with teams who are eligible for the same bowl you are. i.e., A team eliminated from Chumbo Bowl contention cannot trade with a team who is still eligible.

## Playoffs and tiebreakers
There are 6 playoff teams: All 4 division winners and 2 wildcards.

Division tie breakers are done via:
1. H2H
2. Division Record
3. Points For

If all 3 teams are tied, the following tie breaker order is used to eliminate one team:
1. Division Record
2. Points For

The wildcards are the 2 remaining teams with the best records. Tie breaking for wildcard teams is done solely on points scored.

Division winners are seeded 1 through 4, with the 2 wildcard teams taking 5 and 6.

The top 2 seeds earn the bye in week 14. Seeding is done via brackets (TBC from Sleeper).

## Consolation playoffs
The consolation playoff bracket competes for the right to own the first choice of draft slot selection in the following season. The 2 teams with the best records earn the bye in week 14. The losers of the 2 matches in Week 14 between seeds 9,10,11 and 12 will face off in Week 16 in the Scumbo Bowl.

## Scumbo
The loser of the consolation playoff bracket. Can only come from the bottom 4 seeds.

The Scumbo is the epitomy of bad, and as such, they are punished by:
- Being placed in Tier 3 for the end of that season
- Given the last choice of draft slot for the following season
